## Project Overview

Histopathology image classification plays a critical role in the early detection and precise diagnosis of breast cancer. In this work, we rigorously compare the performance of eight prominent transfer learning models—**ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, ResNeXt-50, Vision Transformer (ViT), GoogLeNet (Inception v3), EfficientNet, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet**—on a dataset of 277,524 image patches. Each model is evaluated for:
- **Accuracy**
- **Computational Efficiency**
- **Robustness**

- This repository provides the code used to evaluate various transfer learning models for breast cancer classification, as described in our paper. The study rigorously compares multiple deep learning architectures and highlights performance metrics across different models applied to histopathology images. The goal is to aid in the accurate and efficient classification of **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)** versus non-IDC cases.

Key findings highlight the superior accuracy of attention-based models, particularly the **Vision Transformer (ViT)**, which achieved a validation accuracy of **93%**, outperforming traditional convolutional networks. This repository provides scripts and setup instructions to reproduce our results, demonstrating the practical application of advanced machine learning techniques in clinical settings.
